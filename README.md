# Mohr's Circle

This is a repository for my first foray into Python's web-app development 
using ``streamlit`` package. This app functions to visualize the 
[Mohr's Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohr%27s_circle). 

The app is online on 
[http://mohrs-circle-04853.herokuapp.com/](http://mohrs-circle-04853.herokuapp.com/). 
If you have any question feel free to email me.
